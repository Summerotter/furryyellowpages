Short Term ToDo: 

- Impliment Services (copy Media files, change names)

- Add 'Delete' option for group, media, service
- Add "Hide Profile" option (direct link redirects to index, no longer appears in results)(Partially implimented)
- Add "Remove" and "Block" functions for group admins (Maybe the same thing. Go to User page, it'll have a "Remove from Groups" link if you're the owner of a group the user is in, goes to /group/user, dropdown for mutual groups to remove or to transfer ownership.

- Front Page needs to display 2 random non-premium ads
- Enable Rich Text for group about_me.
- Disable Owners from leaving Group
- Change group ownership feature

Media - Media are meant to be large genres. Examples would be Traditional Pen and Pencil, Digital 2D, Digital Scultpure, Traditional Animation, Digital Animation, Watercolors, etc. There is no need to break down Traditional into Sketch, Line, Color, Shading, etc.
